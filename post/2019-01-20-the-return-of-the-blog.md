## TL;DR;
The first article of the newly published blog, how I got to this point and the plans for the futures

## Published ðŸŽ‰
The blog is finally plublished at [https://mountaindev.tech](https://mountaindev.tech), the last missing bit was having the CI running.

Now that the blog is published I decommissioned the old blog, old urls and all the services I had running to power the old plaform, including, a production Kubernetes cluster, a sandbox Kubernetes cluster a couple of databases and way too many convoluted DNS records, this is a huge achievement!

## Thech stack

The final tech stack looks like this:

The content source is store [https://github.com/matteo-hertel/blog](https://github.com/matteo-hertel/blog) it holds only the content of the different pages/posts.

The blog itself is a static site generated via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a custom theme called [Slimer](https://github.com/matteo-hertel/slimer) originally a fork of [Ghost's](https://ghost.org/) theme [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) in which I've added:

- Webpack 4.
  - Hot reload between Hugo and the webpack dev server
  - Storybook for web components
- WebComponents built with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/).

The vast majority of the static assets are handled by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com).

The CI is handled by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/).

The CD is handled by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) the super awesome thing about Netlify is that I it'll deploy a preview to a temp url for each pull request (more on this in a separate post).

The DNS are managed via [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

## Plans for the future 
As promised in my [first post]({{< ref "/post/2018-12-31-a-new-hope.md" >}}) I'll firs of all cover my PoC of integrating WebComponents in a static site generator, after that I cover what the blog has so far:

- CI/CD integrations
- Deployment
- on netifly

And then I'll add one feature at the time and write about it, the rough plan is:

- PWA
- Search
- Testing, visual testing, integration testing, e2e testing
- Security(headers, tips and tricks)

I'll then cover more deployment strategies:

- on firebase hosting
- on kubernetes

## Conclusion

This is the rough idea I have at the moment, things my change, get delayed or move faster but, in the meantime, if there is anything you want me to cover/talk about, give me a shout on Twitter.

Until next time, have a good one.
