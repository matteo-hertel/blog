# Blog

This will be the source of truth for my blog decoupled from any framework/programming language, just the content.

## Folder structure

The folder structure will look like this 

```
.
└── content
    └── about
    |   └── _index.md  // <- https://example.com/about/
    ├── post
    |   ├── firstpost.md   // <- https://example.com/post/firstpost/
    |   ├── happy
    |   |   └── ness.md  // <- https://example.com/post/happy/ness/
    |   └── secondpost.md  // <- https://example.com/post/secondpost/
    └── quote
        ├── first.md       // <- https://example.com/quote/first/
        └── second.md      // <- https://example.com/quote/second/
```
