Blogging eh?

Sounds like it's a super-straightforward way to share some knowledge to other and it is, these days you start typing away on whatever publishing platform you like and your're golden.

If you want to roll your own solution you can set up a blog on Wordpress or Ghost (just to name a couple I've used in the past) and use the very fancy editor to publish your super high quality content.

As an alternative you can use a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo or go for some new fancy tools like Gatsby or Gridsome, type a way on a markdown file and you're mostly done, these days is very _very_ easy to get your content out in the wild.

Except is not, even just the choice of _how_ to get your content out there can be overwelming, and each and every one of them has pros and cons, no way around it for instance:

- Publishing Platform (Medium for instance)
    - Pros
      - Easy as pie, sign up, create your content, publish
      - Everything is taken care of, from resizing images to social media metatags
    - Cons
      -  Limited control overall, yes everything is easy but at some point you might find yourself in a situation in which you whish to have a bit more control on what's happening and you might hit a brickwall
    - My personal cons
      -  Every post on medium is another post on medium, is not Matteo Hertel publishing something and I'd like, if possible, not to be one of the many
      - The content in not open source on Github
